    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I love this recipe because it's taken me so long to actually get a good
      tasting noodle and not just a good tasting piece of cheese on top. This
      recipe was just trial and error and it's really really good in my opinion.
      I'm really looking for feedback on this recipe. Thanks so much! This is
      really good even days after for leftovers. The cheese remelts and the
      flavor really sets in. Enjoy!

      <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking
        dish with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling
        water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and firm to the
        bite, about 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Sprinkle
        macaroni with 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir 1/2 cup butter into the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix 1/4 cup butter, sour cream, cream cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese, and
        egg yolk together in a bowl. Stir flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cayenne
        pepper, and milk into the sour cream mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/4 cup sour cream sauce over bottom of prepared baking dish.
        Stir remaining sour cream sauce into macaroni. Pour macaroni into baking
        dish atop sauce layer; sprinkle mild Cheddar cheese over the casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese topping has
        melted, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
